# 🚀 Netlify Deployment Guide

## Quick Deployment Steps

### Option 1: Drag & Drop Deployment (Easiest)

1. **Build the project** (already done)
   ```bash
   cd client && npm run build
   ```

2. **Go to Netlify**
   - Visit [netlify.com](https://netlify.com)
   - Sign up/login with GitHub, Google, or email

3. **Deploy**
   - Click "Add new site" → "Deploy manually"
   - Drag the `client/build` folder to the deployment area
   - Wait for deployment to complete
   - Your app will be live at a random URL like `https://inspiring-name-123456.netlify.app`

### Option 2: Git Integration (Recommended)

1. **Create a Git repository**
   ```bash
   cd /home/itop03/Desktop/CProject
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit - Quiz App POC"
   ```

2. **Push to GitHub**
   - Create a new repository on GitHub
   - Follow GitHub's instructions to push your code

3. **Connect to Netlify**
   - Go to Netlify → "Add new site" → "Import from Git"
   - Connect your GitHub account
   - Select your repository
   - Netlify will automatically detect the build settings from `netlify.toml`

4. **Deploy**
   - Click "Deploy site"
   - Auto-deploys on every push to main branch

## Build Settings (Auto-configured)

The `netlify.toml` file includes:
- **Build command:** `cd client && npm run build`
- **Publish directory:** `client/build`
- **Node version:** 18
- **SPA redirects:** All routes redirect to index.html

## Environment Variables (if needed)

Currently no environment variables are required since this is a frontend-only demo with mock data.

## Custom Domain (Optional)

1. In Netlify dashboard → "Domain settings"
2. Add your custom domain
3. Follow DNS configuration instructions

## Performance Optimizations Included

✅ **Production Build** - Minified and optimized
✅ **Code Splitting** - Automatic with React
✅ **Asset Optimization** - Images and CSS optimized
✅ **SPA Routing** - Client-side routing configured
✅ **Caching Headers** - Netlify handles automatically

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **404 on refresh** - Fixed by `_redirects` file
2. **Build fails** - Check Node version (should be 16+)
3. **Assets not loading** - `homepage: "."` in package.json fixes this

### Build Locally:
```bash
cd client
npm install
npm run build
```
