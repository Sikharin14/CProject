## Development Guidelines

### Component Design
- Use functional components with hooks
- Implement reusable, modular components
- Follow consistent naming conventions
- Add PropTypes for type checking

### State Management
- Use React hooks (useState, useEffect) for local state
- Consider Context API for global state (auth, theme)
- Keep state as close to components as possible

### Styling Approach
- Use styled-components for component styling
- Create a consistent theme/design system
- Implement responsive breakpoints
- Follow mobile-first approach

### Mock API Integration
- Create mockApi.js to simulate backend calls
- Use async/await with setTimeout for realistic delays
- Implement error scenarios for robust testing
- Structure responses to match planned API format
